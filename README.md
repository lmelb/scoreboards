# Scoreboard

Welcome to our Scoreboard app! This handy tool helps you keep track of players and scores for all your favorite card and board games. No need for pen and paper anymore! Right now, you can enjoy the MÃ¤xchen game mode, with more to come.

## Concept

### Storage

Our app uses only local storage, eliminating the need for a database. This allows the app to be hosted as a static site, reducing both cost and energy consumption.

### Clean Architecture

We have implemented a clean architecture, making it easy to add further game modes with minimal effort. This ensures that the app remains maintainable and scalable as new features are introduced.

## Start up

To get started with the Svelte app using `pnpm`, follow these steps:

2. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   pnpm i
   ```

3. **Run the development server**: Start the development server to see your app in action:

   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**: When you're ready to deploy, build the app for production:
   ```sh
   pnpm build
   ```
